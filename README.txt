This is a python program that uses Viterbi algorithm to find the part-of-speech-tagging of words in sentences. 
It is more complicated than the usual Viterbi algorithm as it uses trigram probability.
It treats the part of speech-of-words as hidden state, and finds the combination of part-of-speeches that generates the hightest probability to form this sentence.
Uses the Brown Corpus.

After comparason to the standard tagging Brown Corpus provides, the accuracy is 95.3123637315%
